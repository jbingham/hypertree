For visualization and user interaction with tree structures.
None of the classes in this package are in any way specific to biological data.
But there are obvious bioinformatics applications, such as the display of
phylogenetic trees produced by applications like Phylip. 
Tree structures can also be used for arbitrary data clustering, and 
the GUI classes can be used to view any hierarchical relationship.
