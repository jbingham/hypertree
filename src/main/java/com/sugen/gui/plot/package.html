For graphing and geometric transformations.
The model is similar to that used by high-end, hardware supported data
visualization. The procedure is roughly as follows:
<ul>
<li>create an untransformed, 'raw' plot</li>
<li>add some number of filters/transforms to the plot data</li>
<li>map the result to a viewing device, such as a monitor or printer</li>
</ul>
The naming convention is simple enough. Any class with the suffix UI provides
a graphical interface and JavaBeans events. If a non-suffixed version exists,
it is more easily used directly, rather than via the bean event model.
