General-purpose graphical user interface classes for building complete
component-based Swing applications. 
<p>
A consistent JavaBean event model is used for communication between the
various parts of an application. The AppBean interface and the ActionConstants
provide some of the standard properties through which components notify each
other of changes to state. Applications designed in the component paradigm can
be easily modularized and reconnected to form new applications, thanks to the
standardized design pattern. 
<p>
Since Java GUI design still lacks the dearth of pre-written
templates, convenience components, and standardized code common to the
Windows and Macintosh worlds, some of the common functionalities have been
implemented here. This includes the FontChooser, Ruler, AppDesktop, and other
classes.
<p>
Also, it's worth mentioning the various Dialog classes. These were written to
overcome limitations of JOptionPane, to facilitate the creation of simple
dialogs. The main motivation was that the Ok and Cancel buttons on a 
JOptionPane automatically close the dialog, and no error message can first
be popped up in a second dialog. This limitation can be worked around in 
various ways, but a decision was made to write these classes instead. They
form the basis for the com.sugen.gui.form package.
