Higher level utility built on top of the Java IO package.
<p>
The two fundamental types of classes are InputReaders and OutputWriters.
These differ from java.io.Reader and java.io.Writer in that they support the
reading and writing of arbitrary Objects without automatically converting them
using their toString() methods. These various IO classes will often have an
associated interface containing constants specific to a given file format.
Eg, the GenBankConstants file contains constants that apply to GenBank
flatfiles; these are used by the GenBankReader when parsing flatfiles.
<p>
For bioinformatics uses, the SequenceReaders and SequenceWriters input and
output entire Sequence objects in standard parseable text formats. 
<p>
GUI and other applications that wish to allow users to specify readers and
writers as customizable parameters may take advantage of the io.properties
file, which defines the available readers and writers.
