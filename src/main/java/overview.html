<h3>Sugen Bioinformatics API</h3>

This is the central place where all bioinformatics source code, 
command-line tools, and visualization applications can be found.
Included are complete tools and classes for
<ul>
<li>importing and exporting sequences into and out of a relational database</li>
<li>translating sequences</li>
<li>assembling features from multiple exons</li>
<li>visualizing phylogenetic tree data </li>
<li>graphically browsing a genome and viewing multiple alignments</li>
<li>reading and converting various file formats</li>
<li>performing custom algorithmic analysis</li>
<li>building new algorithms, applications, and tools</li>
</ul>

<h4>What's in it for me?</h4>
There are many very common tasks that need to be performed in the course of
bioinformatics analysis. Much of the work is 'plumbing' - stringing together
separate publicly available and home-grown tools. Often, this is done inside
a shell script, Perl script, or simple program. In every bioinformatics group, 
people write many of the same scripts, the same parsers, and the same database 
access tools. This API provides a Java implementation of many of the basic
classes and utilities every bioinformatics group needs. 

<a name="#Java"></a>
<h4>Why Java?</h4>
To minimize development time. We want to do science, not write code. It takes
much less time to write in Java than in C or C++. And Java, as an
object-oriented language, supports code reuse. We don't have to constantly
rewrite code to perform similar tasks. Finally, Java runs on several
platforms. Since bioinformatics has emerged as an inherently cross-platform
field, with algorithms and such written for Mac, Unix, and Windows, a
cross-platform language is the ideal choice.

<a name="#slow"></a>
<h4>Isn't Java too slow?</h4>
No. We're not implementing Smith-Waterman or BLAST in Java. That would be too
slow, it's true. What we've implemented are many of the tasks usually written
in Perl or a scripting language. For parsing, database access, and other tasks
of this sort, Java performance is simply not an issue. For example, when 
importing sequences to a relational database, the bottleneck is not Java but
database access. This would be the case in C or C++ too. Even the
visualization tools, which do some relatively intense graphics computations
for enormous sequences, perform perfectly acceptably on any modern computer
that supports the Java platform. In short, performance has not been a problem.

<a name="#use"></a>
<h4>How do I use this stuff?</h4>
There are two ways to use this API: as a user or as a developer. For the user,
the API documents many useful applications and command-line tools. These can
be found in the package, com.sugen.app. For the developer, all of the other
packages are useful, too. They have been used to build all of the tools in
that package. When writing new tools, the classes and packages already
available provide much of what you will likely need to get started. Ideally,
these classes should make life easy for the developer as much as for the user.
Wherever possible, classes are written in comformance with the JavaBean
standards. This means that, with minimal effort, they can be made available to
graphical IDEs. For now, we've used the Java API mostly for hand-coding.
<p>
<b>Caveat</b>: Serialization issues have not been properly addressed. If using
the beans as beans, there will be problems with serialization.

<h4>How do I run the Java programs documented here?</h4>
You need to have a current Java2 virtual machine installed on your computer.
Go to <a href="http://www.javasoft.com/">JavaSoft</a> and follow the links to the
download page for your platform.
Once you have a Java VM installed, download the 
Java source code or get a copy of the jar file. All of the programs
documented here can be executed by typing,<pre>
	java com.sugen.app.SugenProgram
</pre> This will either launch a full-blown GUI application, or run a 
command-line too. Thanks to the cross-platform nature of the Java language,
these tools will run on any operating system that supports Java, including 
Windows 9x/NT, Unix, Linux, and MacOS. Executable jar files are also available
for some of the stand-alone applications.
