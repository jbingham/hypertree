Licensee may not disclose Confidential Information or use it except 
for the purposes specified in this Agreement. Licensee will protect 
the confidentiality of Confidential Information to the same degree of 
care, but no less than reasonable care, as Licensee uses to protect 
its own Confidential Information. Licensee's obligations regarding 
Confidential Information will expire no less than five (5) years from 
the date of receipt of the Confidential Information, except for Licensor 
source code which will be protected in perpetuity. Licensee agrees 
that Licensed Software contains trade secrets of Licensor.

portion of Confidential Information that a Licensee can demonstrate

on the part of Licensee becomes, generally known to the general 
public; (ii) known to Licensee at the time of receiving the 
Confidential Information without an obligation of confidentiality; 
(iii) hereafter rightfully furnished to Licensee by a third party 
without restriction on disclosure; or (iv) independently developed by 
Licensee without any use of the Confidential Information.

7.3 Licensee must restrict access to Confidential Information to its 
employees or contractors with a need for this access to perform their 
employment or contractual obligations and who have agreed in writing 
to be bound by a confidentiality obligation which incorporates the 
protections and restrictions substantially as set forth in this 
Agreement.

8.0 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY

8.1 Licensee acknowledges that Licensed Software is not designed or 
intended for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance 
of any nuclear facility. Licensor disclaims any express 
or implied warranty of fitness for such uses.

8.2 LICENSED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS". ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED 
CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED 
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A 
PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO 
THE EXTENT THAT SUCH DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

9.0 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

9.1 Licensee acknowledges that the Licensed Software is experimental. 
Licensee acknowledges that the Licensed Software may have defects or 
deficiencies which cannot or will not be corrected by Licensor. Licensee 
will hold Licensor harmless from any claims based on Licensee's use of the 
Licensed Software for any purposes other than those of internal 
evaluation, and from any claims that later versions or releases of 
any Licensed Software furnished to Licensee are incompatible with the 
Licensed Software provided to Licensee under this Agreement.

9.2 Licensee shall have the sole responsibility to protect adequately 
and backup Licensee's data and/or equipment used in connection with

data or other economic advantage), however it arises, whether for 
breach or in tort, even if that party has been previously advised of 
the possibility of such damage.

10.0 U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS.
If Licensed Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. 
Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or 
subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights in Software 
will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance 
with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense 
(DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD 
acquisitions).

11.0 GENERAL TERMS

11.1 Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by 
California law and controlling U.S. federal law. The U.N. Convention 
for the International Sale of Goods and the choice of law rules of 
any jurisdiction will not apply.

11.2 Licensed Software and technical data delivered under this 
Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be 
subject to export or import regulations in other countries. Licensee 
agrees to comply strictly with all such laws and regulations and 
acknowledges that it has the responsibility to obtain such licenses 
to export, re-export or import as may be required after delivery to 
Licensee.

11.3 It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Agreement, Licensee's breach of the provisions of 
Section 7 of this Agreement will cause Licensor irreparable damage for 
which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Licensor 
will therefore be entitled to seek timely injunctive relief to 
protect Licensor's rights under this Agreement in addition to any and all 
remedies available at law.

11.4 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights 
or obligations under this Agreement, without the prior written consent 
of the other party, except that Licensor may assign this Agreement to an 
affiliated company.

11.5 This Agreement is the parties' entire agreement relating to its 
subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or 
written communications, proposals, conditions, representations and 
warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of 
any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the 
parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this 
Agreement. No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless 
in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party.
